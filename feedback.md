## Problem Breakdown

### Exercise 1 (9/10 = 90.0%)

**Part ex1-part1** (ex1-part1.answer): 4/5 points

_Feedback:_ Good explanation of EDA techniques for numeric and categorical data. Mentioned ANOVA for relationships, but missed visualizations like boxplots for categorical vs numeric. Overall, a solid understanding with room for more detail on visual methods.

**Part ex1-part2** (ex1-part2.code): 5/5 points

_Feedback:_ Great job! You generated the data correctly and used various techniques to explore it, including summary statistics, histograms, boxplots, and ANOVA tests. Your approach aligns well with your prior work. Keep up the good work!

### Exercise 2 (9/10 = 90.0%)

**Part 2-part1** (2-part1.code): 9/10 points

_Feedback:_ Great job! You created a dataset with 1000 rows, 6 columns, and a boolean target. Numeric columns have different scales, and you added 5% nulls. The target is a noisy function of other columns. Minor: ensure categorical column has 5 categories. Overall, well done!

### Exercise 3 (9/10 = 90.0%)

**Part ex2-part1** (ex2-part1.fill): 4/4 points

_Feedback:_ Great job! You successfully implemented the pipeline with separate processing for numeric and categorical features. The use of SimpleImputer, StandardScaler, and OneHotEncoder is correct. The pipeline is properly integrated with cross_val_score. Well done!

**Part ex2-part2** (ex2-part2.code): 3/3 points

_Feedback:_ Great job! You correctly used RandomForestClassifier in the pipeline and printed the results as instructed. Your implementation aligns well with your prior work, and you followed the instructions accurately. Keep reflecting on model performance differences.

**Part ex2-part3** (ex2-part3.answer): 2/3 points

_Feedback:_ Your analysis is mostly correct, but it contradicts your prior work where Logistic Regression outperformed Random Forest. You correctly noted Random Forest's ability to capture non-linear interactions, but missed that the data was designed for linear models.
